For my visual argument I want to display the reality of the fast food industry and the cruelty of factory farming. It is common knowledge that the meat used to make fast food is not good for people’s health, but I don’t believe that people understand where that meat comes from and how unethical that meat is. Most fast food restaurants use factory farming to get their meats. This type of farming is highly unethical and unsanitary. However, the fast food industry tries not to bring attention to the fact that they use it. 


In my background image, I used an image of a chicken factory farm. It is dark and there are chickens crammed into cages and one is lying dead on the dirty floor. This is to show the reality of factory farming, then I added the Gaussian Blur to portray how the fast food industry tries to cover it up. It is to show that while they are not lying or hiding it, they try to “blur it out”. Then in front I added an image of a hand holding a chicken nugget. Compared to the background this image is right in the viewer’s face and it is brighter. This is to show that once again the industry tries to distract people from factory farming by making their food look bright and appetizing. It can also be interpreted to say that some people ignore the reality of where their meat comes from; they only pay attention to the food. Then, I added the caption, “”Top Quality Chicken Guaranteed” because this was something I heard from fast food ads, but this is far from the truth. However, I do not know if I’ll keep it. For my next steps, I am looking for what font and color to use with my saying. I am also working on trying to make the hand holding the chicken nugget look more natural and re-cut it to make it look cleaner. I was possibly thinking about adding images of more factory farming images within the letters like the one shown in class.
